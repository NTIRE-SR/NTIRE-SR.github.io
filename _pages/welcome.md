  title: NTIRE 2025 Image Super-Resolution

---

Dear Participants,

Thank you for taking part in the **NTIRE 2025 Image Super-Resolution (×4) Challenge**!

This year, we introduced two tracks to comprehensively showcase advancements in image super-resolution:

- **Track 1 (Restoration Track)** – focused on evaluating pure restoration capabilities.
- **Track 2 (Perception Track)** – centered on the perceptual quality of the results.

We are pleased to announce that the challenge attracted **286 participants**, and **25 teams** successfully completed the competition. Over the past few days, we have thoroughly validated all submitted code and evaluated the corresponding results. The final rankings for both tracks are listed below. 

Last but not least, **congratulations to SamsungAICamera and SNUCV** for achieving the top performances in the Restoration track and the Perception track, respectively. 🎉🎉🎉

We sincerely appreciate your contributions and look forward to your participation again next year. Let’s continue pushing the boundaries of image super-resolution—together!!!

Warm regards,

The NTIRE 2025 Image Super-Resolution (×4) Challenge Organizers
